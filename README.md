# UnityPathfinding

This repository will be used to learn about pathfinding using Unity. It will mainly be focused on the A* algorithm but I will explore other algorithms.

# TODO

* Give each node a weighting so the best possible path is always chosen.

# REFERENCE

* This repository was following this tutorial on A* pathfinding.
